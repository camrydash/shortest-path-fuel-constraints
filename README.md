# shortest-path-fuel-constraints
You are given a weighted connected graph of cities with all edges having positive weights. Some of the cities ( nodes ) have petrol pump whereas some donâ€™t. You have a bike with the tank capacity of C. That is, with full tank, the car can travel for C units of distance. At any city with a petrol pump the car can fill its tank to full. Find out the shortest path between the a given source and a given destination. Assume that you start with a full tank.
