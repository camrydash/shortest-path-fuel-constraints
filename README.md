# shortest-path-fuel-constraints
You are given a weighted connected graph of cities with all edges having positive weights. Some cities (vertices) have a gas station whereas some donâ€™t. You have a vehicle with the tank capacity of C. That is, with full tank, the car can travel for C units of distance. Assume that any city with a gas station can fill the vehicle's tank to full. Find out the shortest path between the a given source and a given destination. Assume that you start with a full tank.

## Instructions: 
Please import `adjacencymatrix.txt` AND `fuels.txt` in the project.

`adjacencymatrix.txt` contains graph data.
* The first line represents number of vertices (V).
* The next lines few lines represent the adjacency matrix. 
* Please enter data in the format shown below in test data.

`fuels.txt` contains fuel station data.
* Enter the indexes of the vertices that are fuel station nodes
* For example, 0 corresponds to (first node) defined in the first row of the adjacency matrix
* Multiple fuel station nodes can be defined by separating with comma.
* Nodes cannot be added if they are out of range
* Please enter data in the format shown below in test data.
